# san_spy
who filled up the san? Becky thats who. 

Literally born out of annoyance that the san is full and the boss is not adding another shelf. 

# Directions
1. set the collector.py to run as often as you want via scheduled jobs
2. run the docker image on your local box and book mark the url it reports when starting
3. go to the bookmarked website to see san or other storage growth over time


# Config
1. set the depth in the conf.ini, this is how many directories it will check size on. if you just want top level leave it at 1
2. thats it so far
